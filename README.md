Project information:

It's simple whitelist for beginners (for them learning)

How does it work?

It basically checks if array has their HWID in and if it's in returns the script so they can load it

(READ TODO.txt)

NOTES:

# Read TODO.txt and this way is kinda (very) insecure for a whitelist you can use 2 urls one of them returns hwid, other one returns encrypted one and you encrypt raw hwid in client and do a check if encrypted data from client is equal to server make it load the script with security checks (ITS WORST WAY FOR A WHITELIST)
